# PoolMate

## Vision Product
Is a service for students, who have to travel to their respective colleges or homes, being eco-friendly,  and help to reduce the amount of cars found on campus. It is called "Poolmate" and its a web page, that will give students another mode of transport and drivers another form of getting income without altering their daily routines, unlike waiting for the bus which sometimes can be late or full of people and maybe in some cases dangerous our service provides security and an easier way for students to mobilize from home to college and vice versa. Our app has been thought on a different way by many people around the world like the following links, but our differential is based on the concept of being useful for EAFIT's students. Similar apps: https://www.wheelscarpool.com, https://www.olacabs.com



In this GitHub we'll publish all the coding (FrontEnd, BackEnd and DataBase) from our project!
